##Interactive Resume

This repository contains the frontend portion of the resume app, built in React, that I'm currently using on my [website](http://sanjuro.net/resume/).  It currently lists work experience, volunteer experience, education, skills, and languages.  The first three (work, volunteering, and experience) are initially lumped together in a chronological order and in a compressed format.  A small set of controls can be used to split the three categories up and to show or hide all of the details of each position/degree.  

This frontend app relies on the data being available through an API.  The API format is still very much in flux, so I probably won't document it until it stabilizes.  However, the format of the API can be found by perusing the [backend repository](https://github.com/sanjuroj/resumeApp-django).
